00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,928

00:00:01,928 --> 00:00:05,320
YULIIA ZHUKOVETS: OK, welcome to CS50.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,790
This is week eight.

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,170
Today, we'll be covering a lot
of stuff on web development--

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,660
HTML, CSS, and all
the other good things.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,770
My name is Yuliia.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,950
I'm one of the preceptors
here at CS50 at Harvard.

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,140
And let's kick things in.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,050
So as you know, this
past week, David was

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,250
talking about all things about
development, anything from how internet

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,820
works to how we actually
construct the web pages that we

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,650
interact with on everyday basis.

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,542
So just to recap some of
the main things that David

14
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,250
talked about in the
lecture and something

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,600
that we'll be covering
today, HTTP, which

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,390
does someone want to
give us the definition

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,030
of what HTTP is to get us started here?

18
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,530
Feel free to type it in the chat as
a direct message for everyone to see.

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:05,200


20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,010
So yeah, I'm seeing some good answers.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,120
HTTP is a hypertext transfer
protocol, which is essentially

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,760
a thing that allows the
servers and the computers

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,320
to interact between each
other and for us to access

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,860
all the information on the web.

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,600
Then we'll get going with
HTML, which essentially

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,040
is a tool and a language that allows
us to build all these web pages.

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,940
And we'll jump into CSS and JavaScript
that makes things a little bit more

28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,780
interesting in our web pages.

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,390
So as we already talked about, HTTP
is the hypertext transfer protocol,

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,630
which essentially allows the
servers and the computers

31
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,860
to interact between each other to
send, get requests or post requests,

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,610
and to get the information that the
user might need from the internet.

33
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,850
And as you might have
seen in the lecture,

34
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,710
David ran a command
that's called http-server.

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:08,590
Does anyone want to type in the chat
what http-server actually does for us

36
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,630
when we type it out in the terminal?

37
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:18,690


38
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,690
Exactly, yeah, so it creates a server
that listens to the HTTP requests.

39
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,890
And so when I click on
something on the HTML page,

40
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,120
I essentially send a request that a
server can respond to and provide me

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
with the information that I asked for.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,720
So we're going to move on to HTML
and get a lot practice with how

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,040
to build web pages, what
components go into it,

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,610
and how all the web pages are actually
constructed that we see every day.

45
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,920
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to open a scoreboard dot

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,910
HTML that I already have in cs50.dev.

47
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,360
You are free to,
welcome to follow along.

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,510
And later on, we'll post the resource,
and you can access the file yourself.

49
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,170
So essentially what is
going on here is that we

50
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,590
have an HTML file that's already
prepopulated with some information.

51
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:25,375
So first I'm going to run http-server
to see what is actually going on here.

52
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:33,380


53
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,080
OK, so I'm going to
zoom in a little bit so

54
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,790
that everyone can see what's going on.

55
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,790
Essentially, what we have
is a quite simple HTML

56
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,750
page where it is a table that
has three rows and two columns.

57
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,610
And what the page currently does is
that I can click one of these buttons.

58
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,320
And you can see that the score inside
the table for a corresponding team

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,820
will change.

60
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,520
It doesn't really do
much behind this, right?

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,990
It's a pretty simple web page.

62
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,470
But we will make some changes
to make it more interactive.

63
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,950
So to go back to the HTML
code that we already have,

64
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,400
let's just break down
what's going on here.

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,730
Currently, we only have the
table code in the body tag

66
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,500
that essentially just builds
out the rows and the columns.

67
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,760
And we also have some other components
that we'll talk about later.

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,800
So to actually go into the
whole structure of the HTML,

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,450
what we can see here
is a thing that we call

70
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,270
DOM, which is a Document Object Model.

71
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,250
It is essentially a tree
that builds the HTML files.

72
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,090
It goes top to bottom as
everything in programming.

73
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,420
So at the very top, we
see the document itself.

74
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,550
And it has the HTML code in it.

75
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,560
And so then it splits up
into a head and a body.

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,920
And we can see that it then goes into a
different component of the HTML files.

77
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,670
So in the head, we have information
like title that goes on the tab

78
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,400
that you open-- essentially
the name of the web page.

79
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,920
It takes in a style, so the
different CSS components

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,950
that we can modify to make our
web page a little bit prettier.

81
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,060
And then on the right side, we have
the body of the HTML that contains,

82
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,600
in this case, a table that
has other components to it

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,810
and also a script that
would contain, in this case,

84
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,290
some JavaScript code that makes the
web page a little bit more interactive.

85
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,290
So now let's actually
examine what's going

86
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,710
on underneath the hood
for the table component.

87
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,090
Well, as you saw in
the code, it actually

88
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,070
is a bunch of different things.

89
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:54,690
Essentially, what is going on here is
that we have our rows that have tag tr.

90
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,890
And then each row has
some td components, which

91
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,330
essentially are like individual cells.

92
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,740
So again, the structure
goes top to bottom

93
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,550
where we start with a
big overarching tag.

94
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,990
You can call it a parent.

95
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,960
And then it goes into
smaller children that

96
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,020
have some smaller information in it.

97
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,520
In such a way, we have,
for example, the first row

98
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,340
that contains the names of the teams--

99
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,720
Team 1 and Team 2--

100
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,120
the second row that will
be storing our score.

101
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,420
In this case, it's set to zero.

102
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,660
And the third row, it
contains the button.

103
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,170
That actually splits
up into two components

104
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,780
where we specify that the tag actually
has to be a button and not just text.

105
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,770
But at the same time,
we can set that text

106
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,740
of the button to be something else.

107
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,960
In this case, it is plus 1.

108
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,390
So the overall structure of the
HTML code is very top to bottom.

109
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:03,720
You can think about it as a tree
that starts from document HTML

110
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,150
and goes into different parts of it.

111
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:13,530
So before we move on to actually
modifying our scoreboard HTML

112
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:19,020
and adding some things to it, do we
have any questions about the structure

113
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,670
of the HTML for now?

114
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:37,060


115
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,010
OK, sounds good.

116
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:47,120
So now let's move on into the scoreboard
HTML where we will add some things.

117
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,830
So these are some things
that I laid out for us to do.

118
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,270
But there's certainly so many other
tags that you can explore on the web.

119
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,560
W3Schools is a great
resource to look into things.

120
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,820
And let's switch to the
code and change some things.

121
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,800
So first, I am going to introduce some
bigger, overarching kind of like parent

122
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,910
tags that currently are
not in our HTML code.

123
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,600
So one thing that we're
going to add first

124
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,490
is you can see we still
have our head and body.

125
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,410
What we're going to
introduce is some other tags.

126
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,780
For example, we're going to introduce
a tag header, which essentially

127
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,780
is going to have a title of our page.

128
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,210
And I'm going to leave that
blank for just a second.

129
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,760
Our next big overarching
tag is going to be

130
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,860
main, which is going to be kind of
like the main part of our HTML page

131
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,510
where we're going to store our table.

132
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,410
And the last part is going to be
a footer, so something that you

133
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:59,120
see on the bottom of your web page.

134
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,420
Usually, I think it's small copyright
tags, that, for example, David

135
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,450
introduced in lecture.

136
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,480
So let's start populating these things.

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,890
First, for the header,
let's do something

138
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:19,610
like H1, which is just one of
the tags for our HTML file.

139
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:32,670
And I'm going to say something
like left team versus right team.

140
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,640
And I'm going to close my tag.

141
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,780
And then I'm going to
maybe do a paragraph

142
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:49,780
tag that says, hey, there, click
a button to change the score.

143
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,450
OK, so this is our header.

144
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,050
And actually you can see that I'm
still running my http-server here

145
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,950
in the terminal.

146
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,810
And it's listening to all
the changes that I'm making.

147
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,850
And so if I go back to
my scoreboard web page,

148
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,050
you can see the changes that we made.

149
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,660
Now we have our big header
that we just implemented.

150
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,040
And we have our paragraph,
kind of like the subtext

151
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,350
that's giving a little bit
more information of what's

152
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,570
going on the HTML page.

153
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,550
Now, since we already have a
main part of our web page ready,

154
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:30,640
I'm just going to copy and
paste the table inside the main.

155
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,510
So nothing is really changing.

156
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:38,290
We're just introducing some bigger,
overarching tags that really

157
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,350
don't change much about HTML page.

158
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,460
But we use it for better
readability and for better design

159
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,940
so that it is very clear to
another user who might open

160
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,720
your code that here's what's going on.

161
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,370
We have a header, the main, and
the footer separating the HTML

162
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,860
into these three parts
so that it's easier

163
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,250
to find information or
change the code later on.

164
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:09,150
And in the footer, for example, I
can say something like made by CS50--

165
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,640
something simple.

166
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,440
It can be made by Juliia or if
Carter was here, made by Carter,

167
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,560
so still using the same paragraph
tag that we've seen before.

168
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,780
And let's just reload to make
sure all the changes are here.

169
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:32,100
And yes, you can see that we
have the title, the subtext,

170
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,650
and the footer present on
the web page right now.

171
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:47,620
Before we move on to other things, do
we have any questions about HTML tags--

172
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,250
introducing different tags
and modifying the code?

173
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,410
There are certainly so many
other things that you can do.

174
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,760
And there are so many other
tags that you can explore.

175
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,330
One of the questions is, does
footer make text smaller?

176
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,800
Not necessarily.

177
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,430
For example, I can remove
the footer from here.

178
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,430
And I will just keep my paragraph tag.

179
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,310
And let's reload to see.

180
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,960
It's still the same, right, because
HTML structure goes top to bottom.

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,780
And it really is only outputting
on the web page itself--

182
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,060
the tags that I'm putting in.

183
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,740
And footer main and the same
way header is kind of just

184
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,920
like breaking it down
in the code so that it

185
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,570
is easier for readability for the
user who might open your code later on

186
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,530
to make some changes.

187
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,340
But that's a great question.

188
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,540
I'm just going to revert
to back to what we had.

189
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,870
Is it normal for tables
to be centered by default?

190
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,970
Let's check.

191
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,860
Actually, we've already
modified the table style

192
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,250
to be centered, which we'll
get into just in a few moments.

193
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,890
But that's a very great question.

194
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,660
Yes.

195
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,120
I think by default,
everything is left centered.

196
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,330
So you definitely need to go in
and make the changes yourself.

197
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,865
What other questions do
we have before we move on?

198
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:21,200


199
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,450
OK, let's go back to our slides.

200
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:32,630
And what we're going to
talk about now is CSS.

201
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,710
Does anyone know what
CSS is, what it does,

202
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,770
how does it make our web
page a little bit better?

203
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:45,900


204
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,320
Great, yes, it's cascading style sheets.

205
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,280
So CSS is what makes the
web pages pretty, right?

206
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,010
We barely have any
style applied right now.

207
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,630
It looks very black and white.

208
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,830
But CSS is what makes all
the websites look so pretty.

209
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:07,170
And with the bootstraps and all the
other resources that are out there,

210
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,330
you can make the web pages really
interactive and really user-friendly,

211
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,350
improving their user experience.

212
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,110
So let's jump into it.

213
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,180
How actually do we use CSS?

214
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,850
So the way that the syntax works is that
you will have some kind of selector.

215
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,210
It can be a tag.

216
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,010
It can be an ID.

217
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,180
It can be a class.

218
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,520
And then in the curly braces, you would
specify the property and the value.

219
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,750
For example, as we've already talked
about, it can be the text align.

220
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,980
Or it can be a font.

221
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,440
It can be the size of
the font or the color

222
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,870
and really so many other properties
that you can change on the web page

223
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,930
to make it a little bit prettier.

224
00:14:50,930 --> 00:15:00,400
So for example, here, I have all
of my components of the table.

225
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,070
So for example, if I wanted to
apply some particular property

226
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:14,650
to our tag td, what I could do
is select all of the td tags.

227
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,870
I'm specifying my tag right here.

228
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm opening the curly braces.

229
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:24,900
And I can specify some particular
properties in the same--

230
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,410
yeah, so it will go in and
grab all of the td tags

231
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,330
that it sees in the HTML file.

232
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,770
And it will apply that same
property to all of them.

233
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,960
In the same way, I can do
something a little bit different.

234
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,640
And I can just pick one
element that I want to modify.

235
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,870
And I can do that by
assigning a tag and ID.

236
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,430
So in this case, I have ID score1.

237
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,360
And I can specify that for
this particular element that

238
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,500
has an ID score1, I want the
color to be red, for example.

239
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,640
And so what it will do, it will look
through the whole tree of our HTML

240
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,390
tags.

241
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,470
It will go in.

242
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,890
And it will find an element
that has an ID score of 1.

243
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:17,720
And it will apply a particular property
that we picked for it to this tag.

244
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,760
In a similar way, if there
are, for example, multiple tags

245
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,040
that I want to apply
the same property to

246
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,160
but they're not
necessarily the same tags--

247
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,200
for example, I want to apply
the same property too--

248
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,010
I don't know-- say, like, all
the tr tags and all the td tags,

249
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,820
I want to, for example,
modify the font--

250
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,270
I could do that by assigning
them a specific class.

251
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,130
So in this case, the class
can specify by dot team.

252
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,170
And I can assign some properties.

253
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,400
For example, I want the font to be bold.

254
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,340
So the main difference
in syntax just to recap

255
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,690
is that for the tags, when
you want to specify it in CSS,

256
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,770
it is just the tag name for IDs.

257
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,349
It's hashtag ID name.

258
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:15,480
And for the classes,
it's dot class name.

259
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,270
So moving on, let's go back
to our scoreboard dot HTML.

260
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:27,450
And let's look at some of the
style that we've already modified.

261
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,070
And before we jump into changing
some things, what questions do

262
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:40,470
we have about the syntax of CSS,
how we can apply that to our HTML,

263
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,890
or anything along those lines?

264
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:55,030


265
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,400
OK, let's get going then.

266
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,060
So what I'm going to do here is I'm
just going to modify a few things.

267
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,330
Before I do that, let's just go
over what we already have here.

268
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,070
So as you can see, we've already
applied some stylistic changes

269
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,610
to the tag table.

270
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,370
So it means that it will apply
to the entire table that we have.

271
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,360
So we changed the border.

272
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,240
And then we changed the
margins a little bit.

273
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,520
And we aligned it to be centered.

274
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,400
And then we set a
specific stylistic change

275
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,990
to an element td, which makes
the border a little bit bigger.

276
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,500
But how about modifying other elements?

277
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:45,370
Well, let's say that I want
my header and my subtext

278
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,520
and my footer to be
aligned in the center.

279
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,730
Well, how can I do that?

280
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,140
My header and the other two
components are different tags.

281
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,560
Let me just start with the
subtext and the footer.

282
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:06,100
And if we go back, we can see
that the subtext has tag p.

283
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,160
And my footer also has tag p.

284
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,220
So what I could do is
go back to my style tag.

285
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,910
And in here, I'm going
to say for tag p, what

286
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:24,560
I want to do is align it in the center.

287
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,130
So I'm going to do
text-align center semicolon.

288
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:30,790
Save it.

289
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,840
Reload the page.

290
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,940
And boom, our subtext
and our footer now is

291
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,270
centered in the middle, which
makes it a little easier to read.

292
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,850
And everything is now in one place.

293
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:56,800
So let's go back to our code
and say I want to now modify

294
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,040
the background color for my team names.

295
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,630
It seems a little black and white.

296
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,070
So I want to change it.

297
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,980
Well, what can I do is
if I apply it to tag td,

298
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,010
it means that everything's
going to change the color.

299
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,620
But it's two elements, so ID
doesn't really make sense.

300
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,520
So what can I do in this
case is assign it a class.

301
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,910
So for example, I'm going
to call it class team.

302
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,510
Don't forget about the dot operator
that we want to use in this case.

303
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,480
I'm going to change the
background color to be crimson.

304
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,900
And I looked up the hex value for that.

305
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,830
So this will make the
background color crimson.

306
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,940
I go in.

307
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,410
I reload.

308
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,150
It didn't change.

309
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,111
What happened?

310
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:51,730
What did we miss?

311
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,420
I went in.

312
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,530
And I did the style.

313
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,420
I changed the color.

314
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,935
But what am I missing here?

315
00:20:56,935 --> 00:21:04,120


316
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,620
Right.

317
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,130
I didn't specify that
my class is now a team.

318
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,940
Great catch.

319
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,840
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go into my element.

320
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,640
And I'm going to say
that I actually want

321
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,810
to assign a class team here and
then class team right here as well.

322
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,130
Save it.

323
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,030
Reload.

324
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:33,680
And boom, now my background color is
different but just for those two cells,

325
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,900
not for any other row.

326
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,110


327
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:45,350
OK, so now what I want
to do is maybe I want

328
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,940
to have my buttons be different
colors but not the background color,

329
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,660
just the text so that
I can distinguish it.

330
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,140
And I can already see that
they have IDs assigned

331
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,600
to them, which is very
useful to me because now I

332
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,960
can just go to our style part.

333
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,010
And all I need to do is specify the ID.

334
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,660
I want to change just the text color.

335
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,410
So for that, the property's
going to be color.

336
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,660
And I'm going to make team one crimson.

337
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:26,015
And then for ID 2, I am
going to make it blue.

338
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:31,440


339
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,630
OK, great.

340
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,730
I think this is supposed to be zero.

341
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,400
OK, I already have my ID specified.

342
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,400
So there are no changes to be made.

343
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,270
Right here I already have add1 and add2.

344
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,870
So if I reload the page, oh--

345
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,050


346
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,220
did I miss something?

347
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,650


348
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,310
Nice catch.

349
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,160
[LAUGHS] Wrong spelling.

350
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,180
Let's reload.

351
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,320


352
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,820
Hm.

353
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,610


354
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,290
Let's try something different.

355
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,120
I tested it with score1 and score2.

356
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,530
So let's see if that might work.

357
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,480
A-ha, OK, this worked.

358
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,240
So now we have 0 and 0
in crimson and in blue.

359
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,613
I wonder why it didn't quite
work out for the buttons.

360
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:38,280
This is something for me to debug later.

361
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,470
But as you can see, you
can also change the font

362
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:47,540
of the color for different IDs.

363
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:56,800
Before we move on, do we have
any questions about this?

364
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,320
Oh, thank you so much
for catching that--

365
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,970
add1 and id1.

366
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,530
OK, let's maybe make
these changes as well so

367
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,930
that it can reflect on
the rest of the web page.

368
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:16,560


369
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,230
I'm going to copy this.

370
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,270
OK, yay.

371
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,660
Boom, it works for the button as well.

372
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,190
Thank you for catching it.

373
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:33,990
Any questions that we have about
CSS applying properties, changing

374
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,350
the values?

375
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,680
There are a lot of the things
that you can do with it.

376
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,810
And there's certainly
resources like Bootstrap

377
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,260
that already have all these
stylistic changes premade for you

378
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,950
that you can kind of just
import into your own code.

379
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:52,380
But there is a question about
how to change a button color.

380
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:59,070
So here, we've already
changed the color of the text.

381
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,850
To change the button color, you
can do something very similar--

382
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,020
for example, change
the background color.

383
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,000
And since it has the
button tag to it, I believe

384
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,510
you can just specify button tag on
top of your code in the style part.

385
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,900
And it should apply the
changes to all of the buttons.

386
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:28,960


387
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,980
We have a question.

388
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,550
How did you use CSS in an HTML file?

389
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,470
So there are two ways to go about it.

390
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,620
And we will talk about the
second way a little bit later.

391
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,260
But for now, what I'm doing is that
in my head that contains title.

392
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:51,360
I also have my tag style that
essentially incorporates all the CSS

393
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,700
changes that I am making.

394
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:00,330
But we will talk about other alternative
way of storing CSS properties later on.

395
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:05,130


396
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:14,580
OK, so let's go back
to our slides for now.

397
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,680
The next topic we're
going to be talking about

398
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,600
is JavaScript, which makes our web
pages a little bit more interactive.

399
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,170
Right now, you can see
that all I'm really doing

400
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,490
is I'm clicking the button.

401
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,610
And it's changing the score,
what is already JavaScript.

402
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,210
But there are actually so many
other things that you can do.

403
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,280
And actually, every
time you see a change

404
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
on the web page, that
doesn't necessarily, like,

405
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,130
refresh the page for you and
bring you to the next one over.

406
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,170
That's where JavaScript is working.

407
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,540
It's, like, modifying some
things on the web page

408
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,290
for you immediately to see without
necessarily sending it back

409
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,750
as a request to the server.

410
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,320
So what's going on underneath the hood?

411
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,410
Let's go back to our
code and see what changes

412
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,470
we've already made in our JavaScript.

413
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:07,250
So as you can see on the
bottom of my body tag,

414
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,920
so still in the body not
outside, I have a separate part

415
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,580
that is surrounded by script tag.

416
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,250
This is where all of my
JavaScript is happening.

417
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:28,120
What I'm doing here is I'm saying,
OK, I'm going to look at ID add1.

418
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,300
And once it's clicked, I'm
going to apply some things.

419
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,980
And the same thing is
going on with add2,

420
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,040
which are essentially our
tags right here, the buttons.

421
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:48,400
So JavaScript code is
looking for ID add1, ID add2.

422
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,360
Once it's clicked,
it's doing the function

423
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,880
of adding one point to the existing
score of Team 1 and Team 2.

424
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,420
And then it goes on to find ID score1.

425
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:10,630
It goes into the inner HTML,
which essentially is the text

426
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,610
that you see, the text you specified.

427
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,540
And it's updating the score.

428
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,430
So if we go back right
here, what I'm doing

429
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:24,840
is once I click button
plus one that has ID add1,

430
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,510
JavaScript now records the
new score and updates the text

431
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,580
that we are storing right
here under the tag score1.

432
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,310
And the same thing is happening for
Team 2, where as many times as I click,

433
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,600
the score is now changing.

434
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,960
So now that we kind of parsed
what's going on in our code,

435
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,970
let's go back and see how actually
all of these changes are happening.

436
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,860
So for example, we have
a statement-- document

437
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,720
dot query selector, parentheses,
quotes, hashtag add1.

438
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,120
So add1 is an ID, as we
already talked about.

439
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,460
So what JavaScript
actually does, it searches

440
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,650
for the entire tree top to bottom
looking for that particular ID.

441
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:24,180
So as we've seen this structure
before, it first goes into the document

442
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,310
and then goes into the HTML.

443
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:31,050
Then it goes into the
body, down to the table.

444
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,500
And then we have our table structure.

445
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,040
And it keeps going down,
down, down until it

446
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,180
finds the ID that we're looking for.

447
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,690
In this case, ID is
add1, which is a button.

448
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,990
And so it had found it.

449
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,670
In the same way, when we
have onclick, what it does

450
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,930
is that it looks for the ID 1--

451
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:05,630
sorry-- for the add1 ID once
we clicked that particular tag.

452
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,306
Another statement that
we just saw is document

453
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:15,170
dot query selector, hashtag
score1 and dot, innerHTML.

454
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:21,560
So what innerHTML now stands for
is really the text that we've

455
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,500
specified in our HTML file previously.

456
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,620
And in the same way,
the whole code is going

457
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,960
to search the entire tree looking
for that particular ID, score1

458
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,920
and going then into the
innerHTML or the text of that tag

459
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:47,420
to do the necessary changes, so
a very top to bottom approach.

460
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,510
It has a lot of things to look for.

461
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:58,800
But that's what's going on
underneath the hood for JavaScript.

462
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,350
What questions do we have before
we jump back into our code

463
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,505
and add on some other
JavaScript features?

464
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:19,050


465
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:23,280
And again, kind of just to
mention is that we're touching

466
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,070
on just a few basic things today.

467
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,310
And David covered some more
extensive examples in the lecture.

468
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,810
But there's certainly so many other
things you can do with JavaScript.

469
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,590
And definitely everything that
you see on the web page utilizes--

470
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,250
all the web pages regularly
utilizes all of these languages

471
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,830
to make the user experience much better.

472
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,020


473
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:54,280
So Python is compatible
with CSS and HTML.

474
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,660
It just, it works a
little bit differently.

475
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,960
So for example, JavaScript can be
embedded directly into the HTML file

476
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:08,980
while with Python, it will have to be
through some different kind of, like,

477
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,940
framework.

478
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,450
It's something that we'll see next
week when we're working with Flask

479
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,360
and we're implementing
more extensive website

480
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,410
where we have actually the
interaction between the server

481
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,930
and the web page going on.

482
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,650
In that case, we're using
kind of, like, Python

483
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,970
on the back end where we're managing
the server requests, while JavaScript,

484
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:34,630
HTML, and CSS are all
working on the front end,

485
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:40,030
really making the changes to the
web page and to the visual things

486
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,150
that folks see on the screen.

487
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,060
That's a great question.

488
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,960
All righty, so moving on,
what we're going to do

489
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,830
is we're going to go
into scoreboard dot HTML.

490
00:32:53,830 --> 00:33:00,220
And we're going to alert the user
when a certain team won the game.

491
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,030
So I'm going to go back into my code.

492
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,020
I already have some code pre-written
here as we already talked about.

493
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,710
And what I'm going to do is that modify
it a little bit so that we can actually

494
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,320
see other visual changes on the screen.

495
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:26,930
So for example, I decided that my
team would win if it has 5 points.

496
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,520
That seems somewhat fair.

497
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,720
[CHUCKLES] It seems enough of points
to get to be considered a winner.

498
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,740
So what I'm going to do
is make some conditions.

499
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,740
I'm already tracking my score
using Team 1 and Team 2 variables.

500
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,530
So I already took care of that.

501
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:48,770
What I'm going to do here is I'm going
to say if Team 1, which is the score,

502
00:33:48,770 --> 00:34:02,770
is equal to 5, I am going to
set an alert saying Team 1 won.

503
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:07,030
Then I save the changes,
reload the page.

504
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:11,259
Click, click, click, click, click,
boom, you can see I'm going--

505
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,650
I can't zoom in more.

506
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,100
But you can see that
on the top, I now have

507
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,570
an alert window that says Team 1 won.

508
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:26,530
Now, if I do it for the Team 2, nothing
is happening, although I'm definitely

509
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,639
reaching a lot of points.

510
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,630
So let's just go back and make
the necessary changes here.

511
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:42,940
So I'm just going to do the same thing
where I'm going to say if Team 2 now--

512
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:50,529
if Team 2 score is now equal to 5, I
am going to create an alert for Team 2.

513
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:55,159


514
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,340
And now if I go back and
I reload, Team 1 won.

515
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,300
I got an alert.

516
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,920
And Team 2 won.

517
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,620
I get an alert.

518
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:17,020
And it's actually interesting to see
that the alert happens when I click.

519
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,370
And the score is technically 5.

520
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:23,485
But alert appears before the HTML
actually changes it to a score of 5.

521
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:29,360


522
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,950
I have a question in the chat.

523
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,930
Could you not use the kind of
[? CLion ?] line operator for the or?

524
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:43,290
So because it is separated in
our JavaScript code by IDs--

525
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,050
we're looking at one
element at the time--

526
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,710


527
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,760
I could not do the or
operator to minimize

528
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,180
the code because in
this JavaScript setup,

529
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,240
it is looking at one
particular element at a time.

530
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,890
So it listens for the
onclick for the tag add1

531
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,280
and then makes all the necessary
changes within kind of that branch.

532
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,990
So there are definitely
ways to optimize.

533
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,660
I'm sure you can click more
than 5 because we didn't really

534
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,190
set any restrictions.

535
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,090
We kind of just said,
like, once it's 5, Team 1,

536
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,120
but we can certainly keep going.

537
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:31,570
And before we move on, I want
to show you one more feature.

538
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:35,290
Do we have any questions
about this part?

539
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:39,260
The syntax is certainly
somewhat similar to what we saw.

540
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:44,440
For example, we have same way of
kind of setting the variables.

541
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,530
Semicolons are back, unfortunately.

542
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,470
But for example, we
don't need to specify

543
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:55,090
a data type or some of those things.

544
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:01,100


545
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,480
So we have a question.

546
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,980
Is it better to select an HTML
element with query selector

547
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,990
instead of get element by ID?

548
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,810
I'm pretty sure both
are interchangeable.

549
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,320
It just depends on what
syntax you're using.

550
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,630
Query selector would allow you to
use it on the IDs, on the classes,

551
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,718
and on tags, versus get element by
ID is just with those specific--

552
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:32,485
like for a specific ID, so depending
on how you want to set up your code.

553
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:36,040


554
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:42,250
OK, so what I'm going to
do here now is I'm still

555
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,130
going to announce the winner,
just a little bit differently.

556
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,170
So I'm just going to
[INAUDIBLE] this out.

557
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:56,650
What I'm instead going to do is
create a paragraph tag up here.

558
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,800
But I'm actually not
specifying anything.

559
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,790
I'm just giving it an ID.

560
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:13,520
I'm going to give it an ID
result, so result. Great.

561
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,820
So if I go back in here,
there's nothing, right?

562
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,370
I specified a paragraph tag.

563
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:23,570
But I didn't put any text in, so you
can't really see it on the web page

564
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,620
right now.

565
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,810
What I'm going to do instead
is instead of creating

566
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,660
an alert that's kind of
like a browser thing,

567
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,920
I'm going to modify something
within our HTML page.

568
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,240
I'm going to do document query selector.

569
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:50,390
And I'm going to grab
my ID result. And I'm

570
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,910
going to change an innerHTML for that.

571
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:59,030
So it's a very similar structure
to what we're doing up here.

572
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:03,380
We're grabbing, for example, score
of 1 and changing the innerHTML

573
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,180
to a specific number.

574
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,340
I'm going to do exact same thing here.

575
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:12,000
But I'm just going to put
in text instead of numbers.

576
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,670
And now if we go back,
reload, we still see nothing.

577
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,540
The tag is there.

578
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,710
But text isn't.

579
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,100
But once I click--

580
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,790
oops.

581
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,810
What's going on?

582
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:35,630


583
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,065
Let me see where I might have messed up.

584
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:45,040


585
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,540
Hm.

586
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:55,830


587
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,390
And I didn't change anything here.

588
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,710
That is very true.

589
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,613
You're not doing it right if you
don't get bugs once in a while.

590
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:07,970


591
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:16,770
Let me cut out this whole part and
just test it out as we've had before.

592
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,940
OK, so there's definitely something with
my if statement that wasn't working.

593
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,970
So let's just maybe delete this part.

594
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,010
And let's check our syntax--

595
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,470
document dot query selector.

596
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,500
A-ah, a dot-- that's
why it wasn't working.

597
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,830
OK, so let's go back.

598
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,150
I can now make the changes.

599
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,010
So we click 2, 3, 4, 5.

600
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:52,290
And now I see my innerHTML changed
to Team 1 won in the paragraph tag

601
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,900
that I specified earlier
but that was empty.

602
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,360
I can now go in and do
exact same thing for Team 2.

603
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,980
I'm just going to
change it to Team 2 won.

604
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:10,830
And now if we go back
and refresh, Team 2 won.

605
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,950
So these are some of the
things that you can do.

606
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,700
As you can see, I didn't necessarily
specify any text in the beginning.

607
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,850
I just put in a plain tag.

608
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:24,450
But you can go in later
on using JavaScript

609
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:29,700
to make the necessary changes
to update your innerHTML

610
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,580
or even change the color.

611
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,470


612
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:39,600
I'm going to Zoom out a little
bit so that it's fully visible.

613
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:47,970
But what questions do we have about,
at this point, HTML, CSS, JavaScript--

614
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,985
kind of all of that
we've talked about today?

615
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:54,550


616
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:59,680
These are certainly just small bits
and pieces that I'm showing today.

617
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,295
But it definitely has a lot of
potential for a lot more things.

618
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:06,670


619
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,345
If you get a score of 5 on both,
will the Team 1 and Team 2 won both

620
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:12,220
appear on the screen?

621
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,780
Or will the first one get priority?

622
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,985
That is a great question.

623
00:42:14,985 --> 00:42:16,610
And we can test it out.

624
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,530
So for example, if I go evenly, right--

625
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,810
I'm updating it one after another--

626
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,920
I reach 4.

627
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,860
So if I add a score to Team
1, we'll see Team 1 won.

628
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,820
But now if I add the score
to Team 2, it changes

629
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,660
to Team 2 won because that's the
sequence that it happened in.

630
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,300
And then you can actually see
that it doesn't disappear.

631
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,330
Once you keep clicking the buttons,
it's kind of, like, static.

632
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,450
It doesn't really go
anywhere at this point.

633
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:51,340
There's certainly changes that you can
make where you kind of, like, restrict.

634
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,790
You don't allow a user
to click more buttons

635
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,710
after they reach the score of 5.

636
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:01,930
Or you make the tag that
we've created, Team 2

637
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:07,220
won, disappear after a few
seconds after you clicked it.

638
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:12,260
There are a lot of components
to JavaScript and to HTML that

639
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,860
can make all of these things possible.

640
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,980
And we're certainly just, like,
scratching the surface of these three

641
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,445
languages today but introducing
some of the most common features.

642
00:43:22,445 --> 00:43:26,230


643
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,660
All righty, if we don't
have any questions,

644
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,390
there's just one last thing
that I wanted to show you.

645
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:36,970
So we've made a lot of
changes to our HTML file.

646
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:44,650
We started by modifying our
HTML body, adding some new tags,

647
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:48,040
as well as introducing
some overarching tags that

648
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,720
help us break out the code better.

649
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:57,010
We've made some changes to the
JavaScript to make it more interactive

650
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,950
so that the web page is a
little bit more dynamic.

651
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:05,590
And we certainly made a lot
of changes to our style tag.

652
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:09,490
And as you can see, it
is getting very long.

653
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:15,260
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 different changes.

654
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:22,010
So does anyone have an idea how we can
make this look a little bit better?

655
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:26,180
How can we make our current
code look a little bit shorter

656
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,725
in the dot HTML file?

657
00:44:27,725 --> 00:44:31,630


658
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,070
That's a great idea.

659
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:39,990
Yes, we can move it to a different file,
so completely move CSS out of the way.

660
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,340
So why don't we go and do that.

661
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:49,690
So I am going to create
a new terminal so that I

662
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,200
don't stop my website from running.

663
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,470
I am going to create a
file called styles dot CSS.

664
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:04,480
And I'm just going to copy over--

665
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:11,290
oop-- I'm going to copy over all of
the changes that we made to our styles

666
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:17,840
dot CSS, save it, go back
to scoreboard dot title.

667
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,340
Now I can get rid of these
tags because I already

668
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,770
moved my styles to the other place.

669
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,630
And what I'm going to do instead
is I'm going to link my HTML file

670
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,980
and my CSS file together.

671
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:39,760
So I'm going to create
a tag link and specify

672
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,470
that the relationship is stylesheet.

673
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:52,350
And I'm going to reference
file styles dot CSS.

674
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:59,700
Close the tag, save it, save
this again, go back, reload.

675
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,160
And you can see that all
of the changes still apply.

676
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,070
So we still have the color
change for the background.

677
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:16,710
We still change the color of
the fonts by moving the styles--

678
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:19,650
kind of like CSS
properties-- out of the way.

679
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,620
We also made our HTML
look a little bit cleaner.

680
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,980
Instead of now having rows and
rows of different properties,

681
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:31,130
we now just have our HTML
tags and our HTML body.

682
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:35,110
There's also a way to move
JavaScript out of the way

683
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:42,100
so that it doesn't make your HTML
file look a little bit more complex.

684
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,150
But for now, we can just
keep it in here as we just

685
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,420
have maybe like a dozen lines.

686
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:54,470
And it's not really
abstracting our HTML for now.

687
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:59,540
But what questions do
we have about anything

688
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,410
that we've done today
about changing the styles,

689
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:09,810
linking the sheets together,
creating classes, IDs, new tags?

690
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:14,470


691
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,930
So we have a question in the chat.

692
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,690
Is it necessary to keep the
script tag at the bottom?

693
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:24,930
For now, yes, because we still have
our JavaScript code and our HTML file.

694
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:29,880
If we decide to move
JavaScript to a different file,

695
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,140
it's going to be slightly
different syntax.

696
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,900
Unfortunately, I don't
have an example on me.

697
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:40,155
But I'm sure this is something
that you can look up very easily.

698
00:47:40,155 --> 00:47:46,680


699
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,830
Do we have any other questions?

700
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:54,730


701
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,460
The question is, is this session
going to be posted after it?

702
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:04,010
And, yes, certainly we will post it
on the website a little bit later.

703
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:08,940
And you all should
have access to it, yes.

704
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:15,340


705
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,330
All right, sounds good.

706
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,260
Well, thank you so much for joining.

707
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,720
This was Section 8 of really
delving into the web development--

708
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,270
HTML, CSS, internet, things related.

709
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,920
Thank you so much for joining us today.

710
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,050
I hope I lived up to your expectations
and I was a good for Carter.

711
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:40,680
But I'm looking forward to seeing
you all in the next sessions.

712
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,000
