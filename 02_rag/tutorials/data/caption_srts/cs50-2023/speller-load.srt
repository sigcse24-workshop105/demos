BRIAN YU: In the Size
function, you'll need

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,965
to return the number of words
that are in your dictionary.

3
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:06,840
There are a number of
ways you might do that.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,930
You might imagine iterating over
every single one of the linked lists

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,750
inside of your hash table,
counting the number of nodes

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,730
inside of each of the linked lists.

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,790
Or you could imagine that, as
you're loading the hash table,

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,310
you could somehow keep
track of the number of words

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,240
you've added to the dictionary so far so
you can return that value in your Size

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,790
function.
